Plan:

- Force chat gpt to introduce one character
- Have unlimited interactions with this character until summarized context reaches a set limit
- Email Professor and link demonstration
- Potentially onboard undergrads during spring break. We would have sync meetings leading up to spring break,
then have one single sprint during spring break. I would take the project from there and work with the advisor
to finish my master's project.
